Imagine living in a world
in the twenty-second century,
after the Disaster.
A world without modern technology –
no electricity to light the night,
no gas to warm the cold,
no tall buildings to touch the sky,
and no phones to connect our souls.
Why? You wonder.
The Disaster destroyed them all!

Living in that kind of environment,
people finally realised –
War destroys the environment;
War knocks down human intelligence;
War kills many living organisms on Earth;
War causes animals to go extinct;
And war is something that,
should be avoided…

In this new world, people learned to adapt,
to live in harmony with nature,
to be happy with the simple things in life,
to find joy in the warmth of the sun,
the cool and comforting wind,
the sound of birds singing,
and the beauty of the stars at night.

And they learnt never to repeat the mistakes of the past,
to protect their world from any wars,
to make it better for future generations,
and to live in peace and harmony,
forever.
