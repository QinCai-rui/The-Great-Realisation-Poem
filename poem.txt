Imagine living in a world
in the twenty-second century
after the Disaster
Imagine living in a world
without any modern technology –
no electricity;
no gas;
no tall buildings;
and also -
no phones or other devices, either
Why? You wonder.
The Disaster destroyed them all!

Living in that kind of environment
people finally realised –
War is something that,
destroys the environment
War is something that,
knocks down the human intelligence
War is something that,
Killing many living organisms on earth
War is something that,
cause animals to go extinct
And war is something that,
should be avoided…
