Thank you for sharing your poem! It's a thought-provoking piece that explores the consequences of war and the loss of modern technology. Here are some suggestions to enhance it further:

1. **Consistency in Tense**: Ensure that the tense remains consistent throughout the poem. For example, "Killing many living organisms on earth" could be changed to "kills many living organisms on earth" to match the present tense used in other lines.

2. **Line Breaks and Punctuation**: Consider using line breaks and punctuation to create a more rhythmic flow. For example:
   ```
   Imagine living in a world
   in the twenty-second century,
   after the Disaster.
   Imagine living in a world
   without any modern technology â€“
   no electricity,
   no gas,
   no tall buildings,
   and also -
   no phones or other devices, either.
   ```

3. **Repetition for Emphasis**: The repetition of "War is something that" is effective, but you might want to vary it slightly to maintain the reader's interest. For example:
   ```
   War destroys the environment,
   knocks down human intelligence,
   kills many living organisms on earth,
   causes animals to go extinct,
   and should be avoidedâ€¦
   ```

4. **Imagery and Emotion**: Adding more vivid imagery and emotional language can make the poem more impactful. For example:
   ```
   Imagine living in a world
   in the twenty-second century,
   after the Disaster.
   A world without modern technology â€“
   no electricity to light the night,
   no gas to warm the cold,
   no tall buildings to touch the sky,
   and no phones to connect our souls.
   ```

5. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some lines could be more concise for clarity. For example, "War is something that, knocks down the human intelligence" could be simplified to "War diminishes human intelligence."

Overall, your poem conveys a powerful message about the devastating effects of war and the importance of avoiding it. Keep writing and refining your work! ðŸ˜Š
