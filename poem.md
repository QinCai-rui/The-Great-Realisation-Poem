Imagine living in a world<br>
in the twenty-second century,<br>
after the Disaster.<br>
A world without modern technology –<br>
no electricity to light the night,<br>
no gas to warm the cold,<br>
no tall buildings to touch the sky,<br>
and no phones to connect our souls.<br>
Why? You wonder.<br>
The Disaster destroyed them all!<br>

Living in that kind of environment,<br>
people finally realised –<br>
War destroys the environment;<br>
War knocks down human intelligence;<br>
War kills many living organisms on Earth;<br>
War causes animals to go extinct;<br>
And war is something that,<br>
should be avoided…<br>

In this new world, people learned to adapt,<br>
to live in harmony with nature,<br>
to be happy with the simple things in life,<br>
to find joy in the warmth of the sun,<br>
the cool and comforting wind,<br>
the sound of birds singing,<br>
and the beauty of the stars at night.<br>

And they learnt never to repeat the mistakes of the past,<br>
to protect their world from any wars,<br>
to make it better for future generations,<br>
and to live in peace and harmony,<br>
forever, in the world,<br>
with the remaining people...<br>
